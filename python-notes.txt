Create a new virtual environment:
  Install "virtualenv":
    pip install virtualenv
  Go the project directory
    python3 -m venv <virtual env name>

Activate virtual environment:
  Go to the project directory
  Run this command:
    source <virtual env name>/bin/Activate

Deactivate a virtual environment:
  Run this command:
    deactivate

format of a requirements.txt file:
  package_1==version
  package_2==version

Preparing a requirements.txt file:
  run this command when the venv is activated in the project:
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
  the requirements.txt thus created shall be used to install the dependencies in another instance of the project elsewhere.

Install dependent pip packages in new instance of a project:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
