Electron bundles node and chromium within the app.

Pre-requisites for development:
-------------------------------
Install
	Node
	npm
(Note: This installation is only for development. The end user need not install Node in their systems.)

***DO NOT USE WSL FOR DEVELOPMENT*** 
	- Electron documentation cautions about this. Refer documentation for details.
	

Setting up an Electron project:
------------------------------
	- Create a project folder
	- Initialize an npm project
		- npm init
		- entry point should be "main.js"
		- author, description and license are needed during packaging
	- Install electron as dev dependency.
		- npm install electron --save-dev
		- NOTE: During packaging for production release, the required binary is included.
			- This is only for development
	- start command:
		- "electron ."
		- set this up in the package.json file under the "scripts" section.
			- "start" : "electron ."
			
	
main.js:
--------
- This is the entry point for any electron application.
- Controls the main process of the application which runs in the Node.js environment.
	- Controls the app's lifecycle
	- displays native interfaces (as per the OS)
	- performs privileged operations
	- manages the renderer processes.

Renderer:
---------
- Each web page displayed will run as a separate renderer process.
- the renderer process will have access to JavaScript API and tooling typically available in a front-end web development.
- doesn't have access to the node.js environment by default for security reasons.
- a special script "preload.js" is available through which certain privileged Node.js and Electron APIs.


preload.js:
-----------
- runs in a context that have access to both HTML DOM and a select set of Node.js and Electron APIs.
- preload scripts are injected before a web page loads in the renderer.
- global objects can be defined using the contextBridge API.	
- enables inter-process communication (IPC) between the main and renderer.

Electron Modules:
-----------------
- Can be loaded using the CommonJs module syntax:
	- example: const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
	
- BrowserWindow:
	- Here is where web pages can be loaded (remote or a local html file)
	- example:
		const createWindow = () => {
		  const win = new BrowserWindow({
			width: 800,
			height: 600
		  })

		  win.loadFile('index.html')
		}	
	- BrowserWindow can be loaded only after the app is 'ready' event is emitted.

- app:
	- controls application's event life cycle
	- app.whenReady().then(...)
		- used to check if the app is 'ready' event is emitted.
	- app.on('window-all-closed', () => {...})
		- emitted when all windows are closed.
	
- contextBridge:
	- bridge between main and rendered process
	- use this in preload.js to expose variables, functions to renderer
	
- ipcMain:
	- to configure a listener on the main process
	- example: 
		ipcMain.handle('ping', () => pong)
	- configure the listener before creating the BrowserWindow.
	

- ipcRenderer:
	- to send a message from the renderer to main
	- expose the required ipcRenderer function in the preload.js wrapped in a function.
	- example:
		contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('versions', {
			'ping': () => ipcRenderer.invoke('ping') // 
		}
		)	
	- Invoking the ipcRenderer in renderer.js once exposed in preload.js
		const func = async () => {
			const response = await window.versions.ping() // why window.??
			console.log(response)
		}
		
		func()


Process Variables:
- process.platform
	- win32 (windows), darwin(macOs), linux(Linux)
