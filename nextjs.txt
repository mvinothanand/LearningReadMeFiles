Node JS version
===============
Next JS requires Node version 20.12.0 or higher (as on 02/Jul/2025)

Routing
=======
Uses file system routing

layout.js
    generated by Next JS
    Add UI elements that are shared across all pages (eg. navigation, header, footer)


pnpm
====
Next JS recommends using 'pnpm' as a package manager.
    apparently it is more efficient and faster than npm or yarn
how to install?
    npm install -g pnpm
Start the dev server
    pnpm run dev
Build the app for production
    pnpm run build
Run the built app in production mode
    pnpm start
Install project's Packages
    pnpm i


Create a Nextjs app
===================
Using create-next-app command:
    Go to the folder where the project is to be created and run then below command.
    npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" --use-pnpm

Styling
=======
TailwindCSS
CSS Modules

clsx library to toggle classnames easily

Sass and other libraries shall also be used.

Optimize fonts
==============
Use the next/fonts module.
The fonts are included as static assets during build and 
Reduces layout shift - due to usage of custom fonts

optimize images
===============
use the next/image and the <Image> component
helps in these areas:
    Ensure your image is responsive on different screen sizes.
    Specify image sizes for different devices.
    Prevent layout shift as the images load.
    Lazy load images that are outside the user's viewport.


Streaming
=========
loading.tsx
suspense and fallback

Partial Prerendering (PPR)
==========================
Experimental feature introduced in Next JS14.
Next js doesn't recommend this yet for production
available only in canary version
installing a canary version:
    pnpm install next@canary
Refer: https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/partial-prerendering


Dynamic routes
==============
[id]

Error handling
==============
error.tsx
    catches uncaught errors
    display a default error page to users
    
notFound & not-found.tsx
    to handle 404 - resource not found errors
    takes precedence over error.tsx
    appropriate for route specific errors

Authentication
==============
NextAuth.js
pnpm i next-auth@beta
auth.config.ts
    in the root directory of the project
    all the auth related configs go here
