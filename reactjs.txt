Principles of component design:
    https://react.dev/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state#how-declarative-ui-compares-to-imperative


Packages:
=========
react 
    - core React library
react-dom
    - DPM-specific methods that enables to use react with DOM


JSX:
===
3 Rules:
    https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx#the-rules-of-jsx
Rule 1:
    Return a single root element
    To return multiple elements,
        wrap them in a parent element
        or wrap them in <></> tags called as Fragments
Rule 2:
    Close all the tags
Rule 3:
    camelCase for for HTML and SVG attributes
        background-color should be backgroundColor
        class should be className

Javascript code in JSX:
    enclose in {}
    the JS expression should evaluate to a single value
    They could be:
        An object notation to access a value
        template literal
        a function call that returns a single output
        ternary operators



Component:
==========
    A reusable building block of the UI
    In react, they are functions that return UI elements
    Name of the component function should be title case (Eg: Header)
    They can be called like a HTML element => <Header/>
